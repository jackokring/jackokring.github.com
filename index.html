<H1 CLASS="western">Welcome to the JackoKRing Page on GitHub</H1>
<P>I am developing <A HREF="http://jackokring.github.com/jarvar/">jarvar</A>
in Java. It is an embeddable scripting language for the Java
platform, and has many ideas from LISP and FORTH, plus some original
ideas. The main reason for developing it, is the challenge, and also
to make a much simpler Java classpath. The complexities of the Java
classpath is one of the features I find most annoying about Java. As
time went by, I decided to develop my own language, picking the best
and most useful ideas which have helped me with programming. There
are things I have missed out on purpose, such as strong static
typing, as this leads to a low interactivity when programming. I like
code to be interactive, and so I chose a good compromise between
compilation and interpreted code.</P>
<P>I am developing <A HREF="http://jackokring.github.com/driver/">jarvar</A>
in Java. A driving game based on JOGL from JogAMP. GLWindow-tastic.
The main design is for the Raspberry Pi, but it should run on i586
linux if the right .so files are used in the build. I have included
the JOGL libraries used in development to cut down on development size.
A full JOGL could be theoretically done, but the Pi does not have
OpenAL.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">About the Author</H2>
<P>I have been interested in computers since the ZX81 and a little
while before it. I have studied many computer languages, and enjoyed
a few. I have a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and
an ability in science, especially physics. I maintain an interest in
Mathematics, and sometimes find myself scribbling equations at
strange hours of the night. I also keep an interest in microbiology,
chemistry and cosmology.</P>
